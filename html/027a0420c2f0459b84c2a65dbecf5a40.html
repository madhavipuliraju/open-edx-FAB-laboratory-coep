<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Machines capable of routing heavy material at many hundreds of inches per minute are common. &bull; Some machines use smaller tool holders MK2 (Morse taper #2 - on older machines), ISO-30, HSK-63 or the tools just get held in a collet tool holder affixed directly to the spindle nose. ISO-30 and HSK-63 are rapid-change tool holding systems. HSK-63 has begun to supplant the ISO-30 as the rapid change standard in recent years.<br /> A wood router is controlled in the same way as a metal mill, but there is a lot of CAM and CAD software like Artcam, Mastercam, Bobcad, and Featurecam specifically for wood routers.<br /> Wood with different grain must be approached with unique strategies, and wood CAM software is less likely to need to have hog-out strategies than the metal ones. Wood routers are frequently used to machine other soft materials such as plastics at high speed. Typical three-axis CNC wood routers are generally much bigger than their metal shop counterparts. 5' x 5', 4' x 8', and 5' x 10' are typical bed sizes for wood routers. But can be built to accommodate very large sizes up to, but not limited to 12' x 100'. Most table routers use a three motor drive system (xyz) utilizing either servo or stepper motors that drive the router motor via a gantry system. The gantry system isolates the XYZ movement in the top part of the machine with a stationary table holding the workpiece. Many CNC metal mills have the cutter motor moving on the Z axis, and a table which moves in X and Y for added stability.<br /> Many wood routers can run at machining speeds of 25 metres/min (linear) or faster with a few machines such as the Anderson capable of 40 metres/min, Onsrud capable of 86 metres/min.<br /><br /> <strong>Separate heads</strong><br /><br /> Some wood routers have multiple separate heads that can come down simultaneously or not. This design is generally not as easy as a tool changer with ISO-30 or HSK-63, though it is easier to maintain. Some routers have multiple heads that can run complete separate programs on separate table all while being controlled by the same interface.<br /><br /> <strong>Dust collection</strong><br /><br /> The wood router typically has 6"-10" air ducts to suck up the wood chips/dust created. They can be piped to a stand-alone or full shop dust collection system. Some wood routers are specialized for cabinetry and have many drills that can be programmed to come down separately or together. The drills are generally spaced 32 mm apart on centres - a spacing system called 32 mm System. This is for the proper spacing of shelving for cabinets. Drilling can be vertical or horizontal (in the Y or X axis from either side/end of the workpiece) which allows a panel to be drilled on all four edges as well as the top surface. Many of these machines with large drilling arrays are derived from CNC point-to-point borers.<br /><br /> <strong>Applications</strong><br /><br /> <strong>CABINETS -</strong> Making cabinet components on a CNC router has become a common practice today. The technology of manufacturing cabinet boxes, doors, drawer fronts, shelves and even countertops with a robotic tool is now well within the reach of smaller shops. Using CNC technology, cabinetmakers are now able to increase production throughput, while minimizing material handling.<br /><br /> <strong>WOODWORKING -</strong> In addition to high-volume furniture and millwork companies, novice and master craftsmen alike are embracing CNC technology in their workshops.<br /><br /> <strong>SIGNS &ndash;</strong> CNC Wood routers are used in sign making to carve images in wood and foam, to cut plastic and aluminium letters, and to intricately machine the all sorts of graphic objects and letters. Full 3D cutting capabilities allow cutting and machining of practically anything.<br /><br /> <strong>BOATS -</strong> Boatbuilding is a natural for utilizing the benefits of CNC technology, In boatbuilding, CNC Wood routers are used for cutting frames, plywood panels and all manner of interior and exterior parts. They are used in wood, fiberglass and aluminium production processes.<br /><br /> <strong>INSTRUMENTS -</strong> Luthiers of all disciplines can now supplement their traditional woodworking tools with CNC routers. While the CNC may not duplicate all of the specialized processes involved in instrument making, it brings new capabilities that can transform an ordinary shop to an extraordinary one.<br /></span></p>
