<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> <strong>Numerical Control (NC) and Computer numerical control (CNC)</strong> Numerical control refers to the operation of machine tools from numerical data. Data for the operations may be stored on paper tape, magnetic tape, magnetic disks, etc. Because numerical information is used, the concept is called numerical control. Numerical control is the operation of machine tools and other processing machines by a series of coded instructions. With a built-in computer controlling the machine tool functions and the system is known as computer numerical control (CNC).<br /><br /> <strong>A typical numerical control machine tool system contains three basic components:</strong><br /><br /> 1. A program, that is, a set of instructions<br /> 2. A machine control unit (MCU)<br /> 3. The machine tool.<br /><br /> <strong>Figure shows these three basic components. </strong><br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> In the NC system, all the information which is required for producing a component, viz. dimensional information. speed, feed, and cutting speed is stored in the coded form as a part program.<br /><br /> The MCU is further divided into two elements: The data processing unit (DPU) and control loops unit (CLU). The DPU processes the coded data read from the tape or other storage media and passes information on (i) the position of each axis, (ii) required direction of motion, (iii) speed, feed, and (iv) auxiliary function control signals to CLU. For example, a typical part program may contain an instruction<br /><br /> X + 100, Y + 50, S + 90<br /><br /> This instruction is interpreted as: to move by a distance of 100 mm in the X-positive direction, 50 mm in the Y-positive direction and rotate the spindle at 90 rpm clockwise. These information pieces are decoded by the DPU and sent to CLU.<br /><br /> The CLU operates the drive mechanisms of the machine to move the table in X and Y directions, and to rotate the spindle as specified. Then it receives feedback signals concerning the actual position and velocity of each of the axes, and signals for completion of the operation. When execution of one line (instruction) as noted by the CLU is complete, another instruction is read. A data processing unit consists of some or all of the following parts:<br /><br /> &bull; Data input device such as a paper tape reader, magnetic tape reader, etc.<br /> &bull; Data reading circuits and parity checking logic<br /> &bull; Decoding circuits for distributing data among the controlled axes<br /> &bull; An interpolator, which supplies machine-motion commands between data points for tool motion.<br /> &bull; A control loops unit, on the other hand, consists of the following:<br /> &bull; Position control loops for all the axes of motion, where each axis has a separate control loop<br /> &bull; Velocity control loops, where feedback control is required<br /> &bull; Deceleration and backlash take up circuits<br /> &bull; Auxiliary functions control, such as coolant on/off, gear changes, spindle on/off control.<br /><br /> Geometric and kinematics data are fed from the DPU to the CLU. The CLU then governs the physical system based on the data received from the DPU.<br /> Processing equipment is the third basic component of the NC system.<br /> It is the machine tool that performs the useful work. The machine tool is designed or modified to be controlled, operated, and interfaced with the Control Loop Unit (CLU). <br /><br /> <strong>Advantages of NC system</strong><br /><br /> NC systems offer several advantages over the conventional manufacturing methods. These are:<br /><br /> 1. High machine utilization<br /> 2. Need for special tooling is mostly eliminated<br /> 3. High quality products can be manufactured<br /> 4. Consistency in quality<br /> 5. Quality is not dependent on the operator's skill<br /> 6. Lesser production cost per unit<br /> 7. Reduced scrap<br /> 8. Reduced in-process inventory<br /> 9. Higher productivity<br /> 10. Reduced set-up time.<br /><br /> <strong>Disadvantages of 'NC system</strong><br /><br /> 1. Very high initial investment on specialized equipment<br /> 2. Redundancy of labour<br /> 3. Downtime of NC is highly expensive<br /> 4. Special skill is required for programming and operating equipment.<br /><br /> <strong>Comparison between conventional machines and NC machines</strong><br /><br /> 1. The NC machine differs from a conventional machine in many ways. Different aspects of the two are compared here.<br /> 2. New NC machines cost around two to five times more than the similar capacity conventional machines, depending upon the sophistication of the control system and the size of the machine.<br /> 3. Conventional machines require a high order of skill and trained personnel to operate to produce complex contours.<br /> 4. The machine hour rate is generally higher for the NC machines or the down time of these machines is very costly.<br /> 5. Maintenance of NC machine is costlier than the conventional machine.<br /> 6. The production rate of NC machines is higher than that of the conventional machines and they can produce complicated profiles consistently with good accuracy.<br /> 7. NC machines require special tooling. Because, these machines are designed to operate at the very high operating conditions (today, NC machines are capable of operating at 50,000 rpm) Tools made from carbon tool steel and HSS cannot be used at such a high speed.<br /> 8. Use of automatic tool changers to change the tool automatically and simultaneous machining by multiple tools are the features available with high-end NC machines. These features help to reduce down time set-up time. <br /><br /> <strong>Coordinate systems and Program Zero Point</strong><br /><br /> To describe the geometry of a workpiece for NC programming, we use coordinate systems with X-, Y- and Z-axes. The origin of the frame and the alignment of the axes are chosen in such a way that any point on the workpiece can be defined by naming its X, Y and Z coordinate values. A coordinate frame attached to the corner of a prism is shown in Fig.2. The directions of X, Y, Z axes illustrated in Fig. 2 are treated as the positive directions and the movement of the tool in the opposite direction is treated as negative. <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> The point of intersection of the three axes (the origin) is called zero point. A point at a distance 60 mm from the zero point in positive X direction and 30 mm in positive Y direction is denoted as:<br /> X + 60, Y + 30<br /> and a point 10 mm below the top surface at the above location is denoted as:<br /> X + 60, Y + 30, Z - 10<br /> It is also possible that we can locate the origin of another coordinate frame anywhere in the workpiece. This new origin of frame is called program zero point. All coordinate values in the program may be referred relative to the program zero point. The different locations of program zero point are illustrated in Fig. 3 <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> With a program zero point at the lower left corner of a workpiece, the coordinate values of X + 50, Y + 60, Z + 30, for example, would mean that the tool is required to move to a point located 50 mm away from the program zero point in positive X direction, 60 mm away in positive Y direction and 30 mm away in positive Z direction. This is shown in Fig.4 <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> <strong>Classification of Numerical Control Machines.</strong><br /><br /> Numerical control machines can be generally classified using the following categories:<br /> 1. Type of motion<br /> 2. Programming method<br /> 3. Control system.<br /> <strong>Type of motion</strong><br /> According to the type of motion, NC machines can be classified as:<br /> 1. Point-to-point systems<br /> 2. Contouring or continuous systems.<br /><br /> <strong>Point-to-point systems.</strong> In case of point-to-point (PTP) motion machine tool, the cutting tool moves to a numerically defined location, the motion is stopped and the task is performed. After completing the task, the tool moves to the next point and the cycle is repeated. In a PTP system, the path of movement of the tool and its velocity, when the tool moves from one point to another, is of no significance. <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> Contouring or continuous systems. The tool has to move in a predetermined path in the case of contouring or continuous systems. For example, consider the component ABCD, as shown in Fig. 5 (b), to be cut from the material. To manufacture this component, the tool has to move in a predefined contour (path) A-B-C-D. The intermediate points of the contour are obtained by interpolator, which is contained in DPU of the processing systems. That is, while moving from A to B (or B to A) in Fig. 5 (b) we just need to input the coordinates of points A and B, then define whether these points A and B are joined by a straight line or an arc then interpolator automatically calculates all the intermediate points between A and B and accordingly gives the signal such that the tool is moved in the respective path.<br /> Programming method<br /> According to programming method used, NC system can be classified into two categories as:<br /> 1. Absolute positioning<br /> 2. Incremental positioning (or Chain positioning).<br /><br /> <strong>Absolute positioning.</strong><br /><br /> In absolute positioning, the coordinates of the target point are defined with respect to a fixed program zero point. Absolute dimensions tell the control to what point the tool is to move, regardless of its current position. Figure 6 shows absolute positioning for point B, irrespective of whether the tool was at A or at C. It can be observed from Fig. 6 that all the values are based on the program zero point. The positional command for the tool to reach point B would be X + 70, Y + 30 <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> <strong>Incremental positioning.</strong><br /><br /> Incremental or chain positioning tells the control by what amount the tool is to move from its present position. The present position of the tool acts as the program zero point. Chain positioning for point B from point A and from point C are shown in Figs. 7 and 7(b), respectively. Each coordinate value is based on the end point of the previous location. The positional command for the tool to reach B from A would be X + 50, Y + 20 and to reach B from C would be X + 30, Y - 10 <br /><br /> </span></p>

Open loop system<br /> 2. Closed loop system.<br /> Every control system, including NC systems may be designed as open loop or closed loop control.<br /><br /> <strong>Open loop system:</strong><br /><br /> The term open loop means that there is no feedback, and the action of the controller has no information about the effect of the signal that it produces. Figure 8 shows an open loop control for a single axis of motion. Since there is no feedback information, the system accuracy is solely a function of the motor's ability to pass through the exact number of steps, which is provided at its input. <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> <strong>Closed loop system:</strong><br /><br /> In a closed loop control system, the actual position and the velocity of the axis are measured with sensors. The schematic diagram of the closed loop system is shown in Fig. 9. Assuming a digital control system, a digital to analogue convertor (DAC) is included in Fig. 9 <br /><br /> </span></p>

<p class="PreformattedText" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif';" lang="EN-IN"> The difference between actual and the programmed value is termed as the- error. The control system is designed in such a way so as to eliminate the error or reduce it to a minimum.<br /><br /> <strong>Advantages of CNC Systems over Conventional NC Systems</strong><br /><br /> &bull;Because the computer can be readily and easily reprogrammed, therefore, the system is very flexible.The machine can manufacture a part followed by other parts of different designs.<br /> &bull;More versatility. Editing and debugging programs, reprogramming and plotting and printing part shapes are simpler<br /> &bull;Program to manufacture a component can be easily called. This saves time and eliminates errors Due to tape reading<br /> &bull;Greater accuracy. <br /><br /> <strong>What is CNC wood router?</strong><br /><br /> A CNC wood router is a Numerical control tool that creates objects from wood. Parts of a object can be made and then assembled using a router to produce a complete object.<br /> The CNC router works like a printer. Work is composed on a computer and then the design or drawing is sent to the CNC router for the hard copy. This outputs a 3-dimensional copy of the work. The CNC router uses a cutting tool instead of an ink jet. The cutting tool is generally a router but other cutters can be used as well.<br /> A CNC wood router uses CNC (computer numerical control) and is similar to a metal CNC mill with the following differences:<br /> &bull; The wood router typically spins faster &mdash; with a range of 13,000 to 24,000 RPM<br /> &bull; Low end hobby grade machines typically uses smaller tools &mdash; typical shank size 20 mm or at most 25 mm. Professional quality machines frequently use surface facing tools up to 3" in diameter or more, and spindle power exceeding 15 horsepower. <br /> </span></p>
